### Aqua Wallet shout-out
(blurb from Chicago Bitdevs)
New btc + L-BTC + USDt + LN swaps wallet from JAN3.

tldr: It’s Muun but on Liquid.

Design tradeoffs prioritize global adoption in a high fee environment.

Basics:

Interoperable with LN but the user has no LN channels whatsoever
Balance is kept in self-custodied L-BTC via app’s hot wallet
Sends and receives LN via Boltz swaps to L-BTC
Can swap L-BTC to USDt and back
Can send and receive like to like: L-BTC to L-BTC, USDt to USDt, btc to btc
Can peg-in/peg-out between btc and L-BTC
Interoperates with Ethereum USDt and Tron USDt
Discussion points:

“self-custody” on a federated side chain…
Not (yet) open source
Boltz swaps taking 0-conf risks
btc “Savings Account”… in a hot wallet?
Global south hodling on Liquid?
