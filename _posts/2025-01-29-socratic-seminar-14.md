Housekeeping
------------

- our meetups focus solely on Bitcoin. We do not welcome discussions about Web3 or any other "crypto" projects at our events. If you are interested in crypto discussions there are a number of other meetups to join.
- Please give your attention to the presenters during the seminar and keep side conversations to zero.
- Questions are encouraged, including basic ones!
- Socratic Seminars are held under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule): share the information you receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it.
- For the privacy of other attendees, please refrain from taking photographs of other people without their permission.
- Socratic seminars are best when the moderator can let the conversation flow, so try to keep things concrete and focused.
